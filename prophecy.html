    <h2 class="blog-post-title mb-1">The Prophecy</h2>

    <p>It's important to understand the early Jedi were very different to the order viewers saw in the prequel trilogy. Star Wars: The Last Jedi featured a mural dedicated to the Prime Jedi, the founder of the Jedi Order, and it suggested he was a servant of balance rather than dedicated to the light side of the Force. The dark and light aspects of the Force were given equal prominence in the mural, with the Prime Jedi representing the darkness in the light, and the light in the darkness. Cavan Scott's audiobook Dooku: Jedi Lost supports the idea the original Jedi were agents of balance, introducing an ancient Jedi mantra that considers balance another aspect of the Force, and venerates it.</p>
    <p>The prophecy of the Chosen One appears to date from this time, and it is part of a collection of prophecies foretelling a terrible trial that would threaten to overwhelm the galaxy. As revealed in Claudia Gray's novel Master & Apprentice, the Chosen One should be seen as a shining light of hope in a dark time:</p>
    <p>"A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored."</p>
